# DSA-PreparationForPlacements
This repository contains my personal journey and progress in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I am following a structured approach to learn and practice DSA concepts in preparation for coding interviews, with a particular focus on solving problems commonly asked in FANG/MANG companies.

I am following a structured approach to mastering DSA, starting with the basics and gradually diving into advanced topics like dynamic programming, backtracking, and recursion. My goal is to enhance my problem-solving abilities and gain confidence in tackling complex problems commonly asked in coding interviews.
